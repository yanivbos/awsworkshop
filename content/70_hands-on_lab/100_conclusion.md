In this workshop, we demonstrated using the JFrog Platform to create CI/CD pipelines to build an application, manage the artifacts, scan the artifacts for security vulnerabilities and license compliance, and publish the artifacts to a staging repository.
Now you have some basic understanding of the JFrog Platform, we encourage you to use it with your existing build tools, like Maven, Gradle, Ivy and Ant and work with packaging systems of other development platforms, like NuGet, RubyGems or NPM.

In addition to JFrog Pipelines, you can leverage Artifactory with other CI servers such as Jenkins, Hudson, TeamCity, and Bamboo.
Artifactory is also a great artifact repository for your DevOps needs, since it natively
supports managing Docker images, Vagrant images, as well as RPM and Debian package managers.
