In this workshop, we demonstrated that using the JFrog Platform to create CI/CD pipelines to build an application, manage the artifacts, scan the artifacts for security vulnerabilities and license compliance, and publish the artifacts of your application to a staging repository. Then you used Amazon ECS to deploy your application so that end-users can access it. 
Now you have a basic understanding of the JFrog Platform as a modern DevOps cloud platform on AWS. We encourage you to use it with your existing build tools, like Maven, Gradle, Ivy and Ant and use it with packaging systems of other development platforms, like NuGet, RubyGems or Go.
