In order for JFrog Pipelines to get access to the code in your awsworkshop repository, we must first set up a Pipelines GitHub integration. This allows Pipelines to authenticate and get access to your GitHub repositories. To do this, we create a GitHub Personal Access Token with the correct permissions.

JFrog Pipelines can also integrate with other source code repositories such as GitHub Enterprise, BitBucket and GitLab.
